[Verschwörungstheorie des
Tages](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/04/mcaffee.html):

> Bank of America's online banking app requires you to accept
> microphones and cameras. McAfee called Bank of America and asked why
> they require microphones and cameras. They replied that -- if you
> emptied all of the money in your account and said "it wasn't me", they
> could check, and then say: Well, it certainly looks like you. And it
> certainly sounds like you.
>
> In order to do that, B of A's app keeps your microphone and camera on
> for a half hour after you've finished your banking
