Bug des Tages: [Bei den EU-Servern von League of Legends fiel der
Spectator Mode
aus](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/euw-spectator-mode-fell-over-recently-heres-why).
Grund:

> A few days ago the total number of games played on the EUW server
> shard surpassed 2,147,483,648 games. (In case you went cross-eyed for
> a second, that's just north of two billion games.) Unfortunately for
> our beleaguered spectator, that number also happens to be the maximum
> positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.
>
> In other words, during the design of the spectator feature, our
> developers never anticipated the Game ID counter going that high on a
> single platform. EUW happens to be Riot's largest shard globally - if
> one were posting this article in Twitch chat, the abbreviation might
> be "EUW \> NA" - and surpassing that 2\^31 digit threshold shot the
> lights out in EUW's spectator mode.
