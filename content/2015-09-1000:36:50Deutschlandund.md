[Deutschland und Schweden sind laut New York Times direkt in die \"Kill
Decisions\" in Afghanistan
involviert](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/world/asia/afghanistan-kill-decisions-us-sweden-germany.html).
Konkret läuft das so ab:

> Decision-making for lethal Afghan strikes takes place in a room in the
> coalition headquarters in Kabul known as the Combined Joint Operations
> Center, or C.J.O.C. There, videoscreens monitor the targeting of
> people identified as enemies who fall within the United States
> military's authority to conduct counterterrorism strikes, and are
> supposed to keep civilians from being hit.
>
> **"They go around the table and say, 'If you see any women or
> children, raise your hand,' and that includes German and Swedish
> officers who are not supposed to be involved in counterterrorism**,"
> said one of the senior officials, who has direct knowledge of the
> operation but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the
> classified nature of the targeting process. "A lot of NATO officials
> are pretty upset about it."
>
> The other senior official, who similarly spoke on the condition of
> anonymity, said: **"This is the last thing NATO wanted to be involved
> in, but the Americans seemed to want everyone in on it. I guess they
> felt it gave them political cover."**

Nicht nur Cover, sondern auch gegenseitiges Kompromat. Das schweißt
soziale Gruppierungen zusammen. Wir hatten das ja auch schon mal in
Alternativlos besprochen, wie dieser Mechanismus funktioniert.

> "They were sitting around there giving thumbs up or down, like
> gladiators in a stadium," the second official said. "While it was
> meant to be a protection against civilian casualties, it made some of
> them very uncomfortable, particularly the Germans."

JA WIESO MACHEN WIR DENN DANN DA MIT?!
