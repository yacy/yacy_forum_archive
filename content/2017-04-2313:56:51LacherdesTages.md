Lacher des Tages: [\"107 cancer papers retracted due to peer review
fraud\"](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/04/107-cancer-papers-retracted-due-to-peer-review-fraud/)

Das ist noch nicht der Lacher. Der Lacher ist, wie sie die Betrüger
gefunden haben:

> "When a lot of the fake peer reviews first came up, one of the reasons
> the editors spotted them was that the reviewers responded on time,"
> Wager told Ars. Reviewers almost always have to be chased, so "this
> was the red flag. And in a few cases, both the reviews would pop up
> within a few minutes of each other."

LOOOOL
