math teacher is low-key terrified of all of us,\' the tween in my house

> So, apparently, about a month ago, the tween (who asks to be known to
> you as Max) decided to start an active, participatory meme amongst the
> entire seventh grade.
>
> \"Save \$500 on bread this year \-- click here!\"
>
> Max, who apparently has unnatural, cult-like leadership qualities,
> persuaded a core group of friends to whisper this phrase to everyone
> they saw at school one afternoon. And they complied. All the 40+ 7th
> graders in her middle school.
>
> How did she come up with this phrase? From the teeming maw of creative
> chaos that is her brain. It\'s not a reference to anything. It is
> purely random. An act of reckless dadaism.
>
> It took about a month for the phrase to achieve complete group
> saturation. At the end of the month, one of the 7th graders \-- Max
> doesn\'t know which one \-- wrote this phrase down on a piece of
> paper, and placed it on their math teacher\'s desk before class one
> day.
>
> Now, at this point, it\'s just funny in the normal way. Students
> decide to confuse their teacher by flaunting an in-joke. Happens all
> the time, I\'m sure. Teachers get used to being mystified by their
> students.
>
> Max and the other 7th graders come into math class one day, and the
> teacher puts the note up on the overhead projector.
>
> \"Save \$500 on bread this year \-- click here!\"\
> The children are silent.\
> The teacher waits. Silence.\
> He gestures toward the screen. \"So\...what does this mean?\"\
> The 7th graders burst into laughter.\
> \"No, seriously, one of you needs to explain this,\" he says.\
> And the class falls silent. Because\... you know. There is no
> explanation. Except that Max is both random and charismatic and
> apparently they all do her bidding.
>
> Then.
>
> Then.
>
> Max stands up at her desk. She stands very straight and tall (she
> demonstrated for me and her mom at the dinner table) and places one
> hand behind her back.
>
> \"Kind of like when you put your hand over your heart for the Pledge
> of Allegiance,\" she explains to us.
>
> She then proceeds to read the note from off the overhead projector, in
> a solemn, declamatory manner.
>
> \"SAVE \$500 ON BREAD THIS YEAR. CLICK HERE.\"
>
> And then
>
> then
>
> (and keep in mind, this was, in no way orchestrated in advance)
>
> all the other kids put their hand behind their back.
>
> \"At what point, exactly, did they do this?\" I ask, when I can
> breathe again after laughing for approximately 20 minutes.
>
> \"As soon as I said \'click here\',\" says Max.
>
> The students are quiet. Staring at their math teacher. Max is still
> standing. The teacher stares back. And then, quietly, Max sits back
> down, and her followers resume normal posture.
>
> \"What did your teacher do then?\" I ask, breathless with fascination
> and admiration.
>
> Apparently, he then phoned the front office to apprise them of the
> situation.
>
> \"Why did he call the office??\" I ask, baffled.
>
> \"So they could call kids to the office and ask them questions.\"
>
> \"\...why?\"
>
> \"Because it could be taken as a threat or some shit? I don\'t know,
> my school\'s weird.\"
>
> Many adults in school administration see kids as chaotic elements that
> must be rigidly controlled or else everything will fall to shit. Any
> \"unusual\" behavior worries them and makes them act like tyrants.
>
> But here is what is hilarious to me: The principal might ask
> questions. They might get some kids to tell them that some other kid
> passed them a note that said \"Save \$500 on bread this year\". But
> nobody \-- nobody \-- is going to be able to explain to the
> administration or the teachers what happened that day. It wasn\'t
> planned. At all. Max was improvising the entire time, and the other
> kids just\...followed her lead.
>
> Students passing a note around is normal. Students spontaneously
> acting on the cue of one of their peers is not normal. Max is not
> normal. Max is a fucking genius.
>
> Even I might be willing to admit, from a school administration

> But. *whispers* that\'s the part of the story they\'ll NEVER find out
> about.
>
> No matter what questions they ask, no matter who\'s willing to talk to
> them\... what are those kids going to say? \"Max did a thing, so\...we
> all just did the thing.\"
>
> They don\'t know why they did it. MAX doesn\'t know why they did it.
> She doesn\'t know why SHE did it.

> Imagine a middle school administrator of average intelligence and no
> particular creativity, trying to wrap their heads around this
> situation.

*I expect great things from Max.*
