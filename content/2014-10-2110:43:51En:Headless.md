= Headless - YaCy on a Remote Server =\
\
YaCy is (also) a server software which can be installed on a root
server. YaCy can be remotely administrated on such a server.\
Either use the \[\[En:DebianInstall\|Debian version\]\] or the tarball
release:\
\
== Extract the tarball and start YaCy ==\
If you don\'t use the \[\[En:DebianInstall\|Debian version\]\] you can
install YaCy anywhere, even without a root account:\
\
sudo apt-get install wget openjdk-7-jre-headless\
wget http://yacy.net/release/yacy\_v1.80\_20140916\_9000.tar.gz\
tar xfz yacy\_v1.80\_20140916\_9000.tar.gz\
cd yacy\
./startYACY.sh\
\
== Set a YaCy administration password ==\
The main difference during installation phase is the setting of the YACy
\'admin\' account: while all reqeuests coming from localhost are
automatically authorized, this does not help to administrate YaCy if it
is installed on a remote server because all requests to the YaCy web
pages are remote. YaCy allows requests from remote within the first ten
minutes and then sets a random password automatically. If this happens
before you set your own administration password, you must reset the
password.\
\
=== Set the Password before YaCy sets a Random Password ===\
Open /ConfigAccounts\_p.html on your remote YaCy (i.e. if the IP of your
server is 1.2.3.4, then open
http://1.2.3.4:8090/ConfigAccounts\_p.html), switch on \"Access only
with qualified account\" and set a password in the field \"New Peer
Password\". Right after you click on \"Define Administrator\" you will
be requested to log in; use your new password.\
You can also change the password here again if you remember the old
password.\
\
=== Re-Set the Administration Password if You Lost the Old Password ===\
This can only be done by someone who can log into the server account
which is running YaCy. \'\'\'The following can only be done while YaCy
is running!\'\'\' Log in into your server and then do:\
\# cd to the YaCy home directory\
cd bin\
./passwd.sh \<mynewpassword\>\
The account name will be \'admin\', your new password is
\<mynewpassword\>. If this does not work, try the \'Configure YaCy\'
option from the next section.\
\
=== Configure YaCy using the Linux Command Shell ===\
There are a few attributes that you can configure using the command
shell, including the password. \'\'\'The following can only be done when
YaCy is NOT running\'\'\':\
\# cd to the YaCy home directory\
./reconfigureYACY.sh\
If this does not work for you to reset the password, try the next
section.\
\
=== Remove the Password from yacy.conf ===\
The password is stored in hashed form in the file
\<yacy-home\>DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.conf\
\'\'\'The following can only be done when YaCy is NOT running\'\'\':
open \<yacy-home\>DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.conf and do the following changes:\
\
\* remove property serverAccountBase64MD5\
\* remove property adminAccount\
\* set property serverAccount to \<account\>:\<password\>, i.e.
serverAccount=admin:mysecretpassword\
\
When YaCy is started the next time, the serverAccount is encrypted and
removed to prevent that the property is there in clear text form.
