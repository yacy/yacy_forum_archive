> In an effort to restore the public\'s faith in law enforcement,
> President Obama made an impassioned appeal this week, calling for the
> installation of turret-mounted video cameras on all police tanks.
> \"This initiative will ensure that police officers across the country
> will be held accountable for their actions as they pour out of an
> 18-ton combat vehicle in response to a routine call,\" said Obama, who
> announced a detailed plan to allocate funding to equip every single
> armored personnel carrier, landmine-resistant SWAT van, and
> battle-ready half-track with an onboard camcorder to monitor police
> conduct. \"If the police are forced to discharge a high-caliber,
> vehicle-mounted weapon in the line of duty, we\'ll know why.
> Furthermore, this policy will discourage the misuse of shell-proof
> tanks in our communities.\" The president added that he is hopeful
> that turret-mounted video cameras would help to reestablish trust
> between officers equipped with military-grade technology and the
> populations they are sworn to protect.
