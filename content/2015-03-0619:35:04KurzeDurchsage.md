[Kurze Durchsage des iranischen
Außenministers](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.645497):

> "It is truly, truly regrettable that bigotry gets to the point of
> making allegations against an entire nation which has saved Jews three
> times in its history: once during that time of a prime minister who
> was trying to kill the Jews, and the king saved the Jews; again during
> the time of Cyrus the Great, where he saved the Jews from Babylon, and
> during the Second World War, where Iran saved the Jews."
>
> "Every 150,000 Iranian Muslims has a representative in the parliament,
> whereas less than 20,000 Jews in Iran have a representative in the
> parliament. So we're not about annihilation of Jews.
