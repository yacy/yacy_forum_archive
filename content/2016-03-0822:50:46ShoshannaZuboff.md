[Shoshanna Zuboff erklärt mal das neue
Spiel](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616-p2.html?printPagedArticle=true):

> The game is no longer about sending you a mail order catalogue or even
> about targeting online advertising. **he game is selling access to the
> real-time flow of your daily life --your reality---in order to
> directly influence and modify your behavior for profit.** This is the
> gateway to a new universe of monetization opportunities: restaurants
> who want to be your destination. Service vendors who want to fix your
> brake pads. Shops who will lure you like the fabled Sirens. The
> "various people" are anyone, and everyone who wants a piece of your
> behavior for profit. Small wonder, then, that Google recently
> announced that its maps will not only provide the route you search but
> will also suggest a destination.
