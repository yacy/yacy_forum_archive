> Sphinx is an open source full text search server, designed from the
> ground up with performance, relevance (aka search quality), and
> integration simplicity in mind. It\'s written in C++ and works on
> Linux (RedHat, Ubuntu, etc), Windows, MacOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and a
> few other systems.\
> \
> Sphinx lets you either batch index and search data stored in an SQL
> database, NoSQL storage, or just files quickly and easily --- or index
> and search data on the fly, working with Sphinx pretty much as with a
> database server.\
> \
> A variety of text processing features enable fine-tuning Sphinx for
> your particular application requirements, and a number of relevance
> functions ensures you can tweak search quality as well.\
> \
> Searching via SphinxAPI is as simple as 3 lines of code, and querying
> via SphinxQL is even simpler, with search queries expressed in good
> old SQL.\
> \
> Sphinx clusters scale up to tens of billions of documents and hundreds
> of millions search queries per day, powering top websites such as
> Craigslist, Living Social, MetaCafe and Groupon\... to view a complete
> list of known users please visit our Powered-by page.\
> \
> And last but not least, it\'s open-sourced under GPLv2, and the
> community edition is free to use.\
