[Opposition vs
Regierung](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/trump-is-making-the-gop-heinously-unpopular-again.html),
beobachtet am Beispiel Republikaner in den USA:

> The Republican Party has almost nothing to offer the average voter.
> \[...\]
>
> But most Americans also think their government is corrupt and
> untrustworthy --- and don't get them started about those clowns in
> Congress.
>
> For as long as the GOP was in the opposition, this latter fact
> provided cover for the former one. Congressional Republicans could
> perform conservative purity for their base, while offering vague
> promises of "change" to the broader, dissatisfied public. And since
> Paul Ryan and company couldn't actually pass their most heinously
> unpopular ideas into law, delivering for the tea-party crowd didn't
> preclude appealing beyond it: In their fight against Obamacare,
> Republicans could equate Medicaid expansion with Stalinism to everyone
> on their email lists --- while attacking the law for cutting Medicare
> and failing to provide truly universal coverage to the general public.
