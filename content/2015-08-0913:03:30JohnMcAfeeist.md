[John McAfee ist verhaftet
worden](http://gawker.com/john-mcafee-arrested-while-armed-and-high-as-hell-on-xa-1722563654).
Er war high auf Xanax und hatte eine Schusswaffe dabei. Money Quote:

> The shootout with the police was highly exaggerated and in fact no one
> was even hit by a bullet, let alone harmed by one. The Police knew me
> and I don't believe their hearts were truly in the shootout, as it is
> not included in the official report. When I ran out of ammunition, I

Und weiter unten:

> At the sound of gunshots I naturally assumed that my ex wife had

Also lustig ist er ja.
