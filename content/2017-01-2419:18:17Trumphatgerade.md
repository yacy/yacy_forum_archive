[Trump hat gerade alle EPA-Grants
eingefroren](https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/823906959090819072).
EPA ist die US-Umweltschutzbehörde, und Grants sind
Forschungsfördermittel. Da sitzen jetzt diverse Forscher auf dem
Trockenen. Das ist leider ein Screenshot von Facebook, ich transkribiere
mal:

> The EPA was just directed to freeze all grants. This means that grad
> students and researchers funded on EPA funds are now without funds.
> All ongoing studies are stopped.
>
> It happened in a moment with a memo, by executive action, with zero
> input or oversight.
>
> It could happen to any Federal institute, including the National
> Science Foundation, which funds my lab\'s research and several of my
> students (including their healt insurance and living stipends). Trump
> also froze all federal hiring yesterday as well.
>
> Please, if you can safely raise your voice, raise it loudly. Call your
> congresspeople, call the White House, write op-eds and articles and
> blog posts. This is only Day 4.
>
> Please, stand up for science and the environment. This is the
> emergency we were all worried about.
