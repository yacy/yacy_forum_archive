[Kurze Durchsage von
Obama](http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/02/01/pres-obama-on-fareed-zakaria-gps-cnn-exclusive/):

> And since Mr. Putin made this decision around Crimea and Ukraine - not
> because of some grand strategy, but essentially because he was caught
> off-balance by the protests in the Maidan and Yanukovych then fleeing
> **after we had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine** -
> since that time, this improvisation that he\'s been doing has getting
> - has gotten him deeper and deeper into a situation that is a
> violation of international law, that violates the integrity,
> territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, has isolated Russia
> diplomatically, has made Europe wary of doing business with Russia,
> has allowed the imposition of sanctions that are crippling Russia\'s
> economy at a time when their oil revenues are dropping.

Alleine schon die Verdrehung der Tatsachen hier ist atemberaubend, aber
im Wesentlichen gibt Obama hier zu Protokoll, dass der Umsturz in der
Ukraine ein Putsch der USA war. Krass.
