Money Quote:

> More comfortable in their bedrooms than in a car or at a party,
> today's teens are physically safer than teens have ever been. They're
> markedly less likely to get into a car accident and, having less of a
> taste for alcohol than their predecessors, are less susceptible to
> drinking's attendant ills.
>
> Psychologically, however, they are more vulnerable than Millennials
> were: Rates of teen depression and suicide have skyrocketed since
> 2011. It's not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink
> of the worst mental-health crisis in decades. Much of this
> deterioration can be traced to their phones.

Und dann, fast noch spannender:

> Today's teens are also less likely to date. The initial stage of
> courtship, which Gen Xers called "liking" (as in "Ooh, he likes
> you!"), kids now call "talking"---an ironic choice for a generation
> that prefers texting to actual conversation. After two teens have
> "talked" for a while, they might start dating. But only about 56
> percent of high-school seniors in 2015 went out on dates; for Boomers
> and Gen Xers, the number was about 85 percent.
>
> The decline in dating tracks with a decline in sexual activity. The
> drop is the sharpest for ninth-graders, among whom the number of
> sexually active teens has been cut by almost 40 percent since 1991.
> The average teen now has had sex for the first time by the spring of
> 11th grade, a full year later than the average Gen Xer. Fewer teens
> having sex has contributed to what many see as one of the most
> positive youth trends in recent years: The teen birth rate hit an
> all-time low in 2016, down 67 percent since its modern peak, in 1991.

Smartphones und Social Networks sind ein Verhütungsmittel!

Ich stelle mir gerade vor, wie die Identitären Smartphones über Afrika
aus Flugzeugen abwerfen. :)

Wartet, geht noch weiter:

> The Monitoring the Future survey, funded by the National Institute on
> Drug Abuse and designed to be nationally representative, has asked
> 12th-graders more than 1,000 questions every year since 1975 and
> queried eighth- and 10th-graders since 1991. The survey asks teens how
> happy they are and also how much of their leisure time they spend on
> various activities, including nonscreen activities such as in-person
> social interaction and exercise, and, in recent years, screen
> activities such as using social media, texting, and browsing the web.
> The results could not be clearer: Teens who spend more time than
> average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those
> who spend more time than average on nonscreen activities are more
> likely to be happy.
>
> There's not a single exception. All screen activities are linked to
> less happiness, and all nonscreen activities are linked to more
> happiness.
