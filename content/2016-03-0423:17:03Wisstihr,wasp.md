Wisst ihr, was passiert, wenn man so Bullshit wie \"CSI Cyber\" im
Fernsehen laufen hat? [Sowas
hier](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/san-bernardino-da-says-seized-iphone-may-hold-dormant-cyber-pathogen/):

> \"The iPhone is a county owned telephone that may have connected to
> the San Bernardino County computer network. The seized iPhone may
> contain evidence that can only be found on the seized phone that it
> was **used as a weapon to introduce a lying dormant cyber pathogen**
> that endangers San Bernardino\'s infrastructure,\" according to a
> court filing (PDF) by Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County
> district attorney.

Un-fucking-believable.
